			<p>
				Rabbits are herbivores that feed on mainly on grass, but rabbits also eat nuts and berries
				and often fruit and vegetables. Rabbits dig burrows into the ground where the rabbit hides
				and stores food, and also gives birth to and raises the baby rabbits.
				Much like a dog, a pet rabbit can be taught to come to his/her name, sit in your lap,
				and do simple tricks.
				Rabbits are often used as a symbol of fertility or rebirth, and have
				long been associated with spring and Easter as the Easter Bunny.  </p>
